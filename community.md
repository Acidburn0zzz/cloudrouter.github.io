**Code of Conduct**

The CloudRouter Project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.  We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

The code of conduct applies to all CloudRouter Project spaces, both online and off.  Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the CloudRouter response team.

**License**

For the CloudRouter Project license terms, please visit <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/license/">{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/license/</a>.  Just as with other Linux distributions, most of the CloudRouter Project components are individually licensed.  For example the kernel is licensed under GPLv2, Python is licensed under the Python license.  Perl is licensed under a combination including GPLv2, MIT, and Public Domain.  The software components which are unique to the CloudRouter Project, such as the cloudrouter-release package, are licensed under AGPLv3.  We have chosen this license because the Free Software Foundation (FSF) recommends the AGPLv3 as an appropriate license for software that will be run over a network.  The AGPL is FSF and OSI approved, GPL-compatible and copyleft.  It also benefits the community by ensuring that any changes made to the content licensed under the AGPL by developers contributing to, and organizations using the CloudRouter Project, are contributed back to the community.
