excerpt: OpenDaylight has a mighty membership roster – just about any vendor that's ever considered SDN or NFV, or can spell either, has signed as a member – so its participation in this project means it deserves to be taken seriously. The project is also motivated by the desire to provide an open alternative to commercial SDN and NFV, which means it has every chance of becoming increasingly relevant.
