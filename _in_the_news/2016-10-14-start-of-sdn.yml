excerpt: The notion that we're on the edge of widespread SDN (software-defined networking) adoption has been rumored for years, now. It seems there's always a new report on when SDN will catch on and how big of a success it will be. While these reports are usually over optimistic, they have me thinking about when the tipping point of SDN will be reached â€“ when the momentum and notoriety the SDN movement is gaining will finally pass the threshold separating isolated experimentation from widespread adoption.
