excerpt: The complexity of the Internet of Things means that only something as centrally manageable, scalable and flexible as software-defined networking (SDN) has a shot at dealing with the overwhelming data flows being generated by IoT devices. In fact, the prolific increase in the amount of traffic and devices is a key motivation for the rapid development and deployment of SDN technology.
