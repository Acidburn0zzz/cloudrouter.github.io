excerpt: The idea behind software-defined networking (SDN) is to abstract physical elements from networking hardware and control them with software.  Part of this is decoupling network control from forwarding functions so you can program it directly, but the main idea is that this separation allows for a dynamic approach to networking â€“ something that the increasing disaggregation in IT makes a necessity.
