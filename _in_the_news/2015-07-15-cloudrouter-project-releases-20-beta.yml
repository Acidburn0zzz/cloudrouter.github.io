excerpt: Six months after the CloudRouter Project released the 1.0 beta version of its open-source router software, the organization has announced public availability of its 2.0 beta version. The new version adds considerable functionality, most notably the inclusion of a full version of OpenDaylight Lithium network control platform software. It does not, however, include technology resulting from a university partnership that CloudRouter announced recently.
