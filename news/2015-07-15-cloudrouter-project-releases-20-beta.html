<h2>CloudRouter Project releases 2.0 beta</h2>
<p>

Six months after the CloudRouter Project released the 1.0 beta version of its open-source router software, the organization has announced public availability of its 2.0 beta version. The new version adds considerable functionality, most notably the inclusion of a full version of OpenDaylight Lithium network control platform software. It does not, however, include technology resulting from a university partnership that CloudRouter announced recently.
<p>
In addition to ODL, the latest platform release from the Linux Foundation-hosted OpenDaylight Project, CloudRouter also includes ONOS 1.2 (Cardinal), another network control platform which targets service provider networks in particular. ONOS, developed by the Open Networking Lab, has the backing of AT&T and NTT, whereas ODL has particularly significant vendor support. Lithium is the third OpenDaylight release, following Hydrogen and Helium. Last year Brocade Communications Systems announced an SDN controller based on OpenDaylight open-source code.

The original target of CloudRouter is enterprise networks, though some backers have said that they hope to push it into the carrier space as well. These ONOS 1.2 support is a step in that direction.

Other components of CloudRouter 2.0 beta include the Fedora 22 Linux-based cloud operating system, the Mininet SDN emulator for speeding up prototyping of software defined networks, and the FastNetMon security monitoring toolkit.
<p>
The technology not included in the 2.0 beta release is layer 3 router configuration automation functionality for OpenDaylight. Since CloudRouter announced the partnership with Australia National University to develop the technology only on June 16, presumably it will make an appearance in future releases.
<p>
The CloudRouter 1.0 beta itself provided considerable functionality. This included the ability to run on both public and private cloud infrastructure; support for Docker, Cloudius OSv and KVM images; and support for security standards including IPsec, VPN, SSL and L2TP. It also focused on high availability and redundancy as well as minimal consumption of resources. Supporters who contributed to 1.0 beta included CloudBees, Cloudius, IIX, NGINX and OpenDaylight.
