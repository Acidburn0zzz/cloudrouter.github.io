<h2>CloudRouter Achieves 650 Gb/s & Expands Into SDN</h2>
<p>
31 Mar 2016 - SDxCentral - <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/cloudrouter-achieves-650-gbs-expands-into-sdn/2016/03/">Link</a>
<p>
The Linux-based <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/listings/cloudrouter/">CloudRouter Project</a>, which is working on code for an open source <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/resources/nfv/whats-a-virtual-router-vrouter/">virtual router</a>, released version 3.0 this week. It adds Linux Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) kernel enhancements and claims throughput in excess of 650 Gb/s on commodity hardware.
<p>
To demonstrate the 650 Gb/s throughput, CloudRouter used a <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/listings/mellanox-technologies/">Mellanox</a> network interface card (NIC).
<p>
CloudRouter is rallying a community for an <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/cloudrouter-moves-its-open-source-vrouter-into-beta/2015/07/">open source vRouter</a> that can present a real threat to routing behemoths such as <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/channel/cisco/">Cisco</a>. And with its version 3.0, itâ€™s now expanded its scope to support <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/resources/sdn/why-sdn-software-defined-networking-or-nfv-network-functions-virtualization-now/">software-defined networking (SDN)</a>.
<p>
CloudRouter says it received community requests for higher performance to enable <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/flow/sdn-software-defined-networking/">SDN</a> deployments for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 connections. So the team incorporated new open source technology from the DPDK project to enhance network performance and support for 100-Gb/s Ethernet cards.
<p>
Version 3.0 ships with <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/projects/on-lab-open-network-operating-system-onos/">Open Network Operating System (ONOS)</a> Drake 1.4 in addition to <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/resources/sdn/opendaylight-project/">OpenDaylight Lithium</a>. And four new open source projects have been added to the project, including an <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/resources/sdn/">SDN</a> exchange point, two new network traffic generators and analyzers, and a network monitoring utility.

<a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/listings/iix/">IIX</a>, the <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/cloudrouter-launch-brings-new-open-source-virtual-router/2015/03/">initiator of CloudRouter</a>, is still its largest user, according to Jay Turner, who heads the project and is also the senior director of <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/flow/devops/">DevOps</a> at IIX.
