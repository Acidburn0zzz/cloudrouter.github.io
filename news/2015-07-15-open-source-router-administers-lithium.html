<h3>Claims first script of latest OpenDaylight SDN code</h3>
<p>
The CloudRouter Project, a months-old effort to open source cloud routing, is announcing first shipment of OpenDaylight’s new “Lithium” SDN controller.
<p>
OpenDaylight is a participant in the CloudRouter Project, and Lithium was released two weeks ago. It is OpenDaylight’s third SDN controller release and includes enhancements in security and automation, scalability, performance, OpenStack and group-based policy, including support for Cisco/Citrix/IBM/Microsoft/Sungard OpFlex policy protocol.
<p>
OpFlex is one of six new protocols in Lithium.
<p>
The CloudRouter Project debuted in March with support from CloudBees, Cloudius, IIX, NGINX, and OpenDaylight. This week, the open source group released a Lithium beta called CloudRouter 2.0.
<p>
In addition to OpenDaylight Lithium, CloudRouter 2.0 also supports the Open Networking Operating System 1.2 release from ON.Lab; Fedora Remix based on the Fedora 22 open source operating system; the Mininet SDN emulator; the FastNetMon DoS monitoring toolkit; containers for running applications based on the App Container specification; ExaBGP, a lightweight BGP routing daemon added in addition to BIRD and Quagga; and Java 1.8 for Open Daylight and ONOS.
<p>
Earlier in the year, CloudRouter announced a technology partnership with Australia National University to build Layer 3 router configuration automation technology for OpenDaylight but this technology is not included in CloudRouter 2.0.
<p>
CloudRouter 2.0 beta is available for download now. Carryovers from CloudRouter 1.0 include:
<ul>
<li>capability to run on public and private cloud infrastructures at scale with an automated configuration system;
<li>container-ready, including support for Docker, Cloudius OSv,  and KVM images;
<li>secure connectivity using IPSec VPN, SSL or L2TP;
<li>monitoring and reporting with integrated network protocol analysis;
<li>high-availability and system redundancy with failover and synchronization.
</ul>
