<h2>ONOS chief architect hopes to add clustering features over the next year</h2>

Now a Linux Foundation project, the Open Network Operating System project is likely to attract more attention.
<p>
On the <a href="https://cloudrouter.org/cloudrouter/2015/10/15/onos-interview.html">CloudRouter Project's blog</a>, Thomas Vachuska, ONOS's chief architect, indicated that since ON.Lab launched the open source software-defined networking project in December 2014, several collaborators and contributors have joined. The number is growing, he noted. It will probably do so more rapidly now that ONOS is a Linux Foundation project.
<p>
As one of a handful of open networking projects, ONOS is vying for a space in SDN. What's interesting about there being multiple open networking projects, though, is the way vendors and other open source projects are using and contributing to them.
<p>
Take CloudRouter as an example. The organization is building its cloud-based SDN product around parts of OpenDaylight, parts of ONOS and also incorporating other open source.
<p>
In the blog, written as a Q&A between Vachuska and CloudRouter Project lead Jay Turner, Vachuska doesn't exactly provide a roadmap for ONOS, but he did shine some light on his goals for the project over the next year.
<p>
At the top of his list is "to achieve field trial runs of the ONOS CORD use case – Central Office Re-imagined as Data center – as well as multi-layer network control of optical networks."
<p>
Vachuska also hopes to add more functionality to ONOS, including the ability to dynamically adjust cluster sizes, support geographically distributed clusters and allow federation from different ONOS clusters.
<p>
"We also want to make sure that ONOS has first-class support for OpenStack integration and for network virtualization; not just at the edge, but also in the core fabric," Vachuska noted.
