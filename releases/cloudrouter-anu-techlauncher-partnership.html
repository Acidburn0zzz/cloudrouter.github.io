<h2>Australian National University TechLauncher Program Partners with the CloudRouter Project</h2>
<p>
<h3>ANU TechLauncher Program and the CloudRouter Project partner on new research project to extend OpenDaylight automated SDN configuration to layer 3 routing</h3>
<p>
SANTA CLARA, Calif.—June 17, 2015— The CloudRouter® Project, created to advance the development of secure Linux-based open source routing and SDN technologies for large-scale cloud companies, data centers, enterprises and network operators, today announced a partnership with The Australian National University (ANU) TechLauncher program. Members in the program will lead development of open source technologies to extend the functionality of OpenDaylight, a popular SDN project that the CloudRouter Project packages and distributes along with other open source networking technologies.
 
ANU joins a long list of technology leaders involved in the CloudRouter Project. The original sponsors announced in March include CloudBees, Cloudius Systems, IIX, NGINX and OpenDaylight.  ANU is the first academic sponsor to take on the research and development of a major networking component of CloudRouter.  Their focus will be to automate layer 3 router configuration, starting with an enhanced border gateway protocol (BGP) implementation that will allow OpenDaylight to advertise routes, effectively suggesting traffic routes between network and router. Future applications will be able to modify routes, automating a process that is largely performed manually today.

“We’re excited to join the CloudRouter Project, the leading open source project for network routing technologies,” said Dr. Shayne Flint, Senior Lecturer at the ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science. “It’s an incredible opportunity for our students to work with an open source team that has strong ties to the industry and can bring technology developed in academic centers into real-world deployment. We value this support and strong exchange of network technology research between academia and industry.” 
 
“The ANU team brings a tremendous level of technical talent to the CloudRouter Project and we welcome that this team is taking on the challenge of extending SDN automation concepts from layer 2 switching to layer 3 routing,” said Jay Turner, CloudRouter Project Lead and Senior Director of DevOps at IIX. “Since the launch of the CloudRouter Project, there has been incredible interest by both research groups and software engineers from various industries to participate and advance open source routing technologies.” 
 
ANU students will focus on developing a configuration interface for the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL). The RPSL parser will be based on RIPE NCC code, and will be available as open source software. As part of the announcement, IIX, one of the founding members of the CloudRouter Project, is sponsoring a portion of the academic research at ANU.  IIX is also increasing the number of engineers they have assigned to work on this open source community project and currently has paid positions open to work on the project full-time.

<h3>About the CloudRouter Project</h3>
The CloudRouter Project is a collaborative open source project to develop a freely available software-based router designed to securely run on physical, virtual and cloud environments that support software-defined networking infrastructures. CloudRouter aims to facilitate migration to the cloud without giving up control over network routing and governance. It includes the features of traditional hardware routers, as well as support for emerging technologies such as containers and software-defined interconnection. To help bridge legacy infrastructure with the cloud, the project is  focused on bringing simplicity to network interconnection, a traditionally complex process. The CloudRouter Project sponsors include CloudBees, Cloudius Systems, IIX, NGINX and OpenDaylight.

<h3>About ANU TechLauncher</h3>
TechLauncher is an ANU Research School of Computer Science initiative which enables students from any discipline to develop the research and professional skills required to use technology to bring great ideas to life and have a positive impact on our society. Students develop these skill by working closely with industry professionals, technology experts and entrepreneurs to create start-up companies or to work on complex real-world problems. In 2015 we have 120 3rd and 4th year students enrolled in the course which runs over two semesters. Many of our 3rd year students will continue with the program in their 4th year.
