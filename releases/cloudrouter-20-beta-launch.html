<h2>CloudRouter 2.0 Beta Launches</h2>
<p>
<h3>First to Market with OpenDaylight Lithium</h3>

<p>
SANTA CLARA, Calif.—July 15, 2015— The CloudRouter® Project today announced the public availability of CloudRouter 2.0 beta.  The new version of the leading open source router is the first to ship with a full version of OpenDaylight Lithium, the latest open source SDN release from the OpenDaylight Project.  This is the first major upgrade of CloudRouter.  A 1.0 beta version was announced earlier this year with support from CloudBees, Cloudius, IIX, NGINX, and OpenDaylight.
<p>
New in CloudRouter 2.0 beta:
<ul>
<li>Fedora Remix based on Fedora 22
<li>ONOS 1.2 (Cardinal)
<li>ODL Lithium
<li>Mininet - Emulator for rapid prototyping of Software Defined Networks
<li>FastNetMon - DDoS and DoS monitoring toolkit for security
<li>CoreOS Rkt containers support - Container for running applications based on the App Container specification
<li>ExaBGP - Lightweight BGP routing daemon added in addition to BIRD and Quagga
<li>Java 1.8 - Performance and security improvements for ODL and ONOS
</ul>
<p>
“I want to thank all the members of the CloudRouter Project who helped make the best possible 
open source router freely available to everyone,” said Jay Turner, CloudRouter Project Lead 
and Senior Director of DevOps at IIX.  “We’ve had all types of groups come out and volunteer to 
help, from major academic centers to global technology giants.  We also know of a number of 
successful deployments by very large companies which we’ll provide details on in the future.”
<p>
"It's great to see OpenDaylight Lithium adoption by the CloudRouter project so soon after the 
launch," said Neela Jacques, executive director, OpenDaylight. "This is a testament to the 
quality of Lithium code and improved engineering workflow. People that want to deploy Lithium 
can now get easy installation and tested components in the new version of CloudRouter.”
<p>
Earlier in the year, CloudRouter also announced a <a href="https://cloudrouter.org/releases/cloudrouter-anu-techlauncher-partnership.html">technology partnership with Australia National University</a> to build layer 3 router configuration automation technology for 
OpenDaylight.  This technology is not included in CloudRouter 2.0 beta.  Stay tuned. 
<p>
<a href="https://cloudrouter.org/getting-started/">CloudRouter 2.0 beta</a> is available for download and use now.  The key guiding features from 1.0 that are carried through in 2.0 are:
<ul>
<li>capability to run on public and private cloud infrastructures at scale with a 
fully­automated configuration system 
<li>container­ready, including support for Docker, Cloudius OSv,  and KVM images
<li>secure connectivity using standards­based IPSec VPN, SSL or L2TP
<li>monitoring and reporting with integrated network protocol analysis for network detail at a 
fine­grained level 
<li>high availability and system redundancy with failover and synchronization
<li>minimal resource consumption.
</ul>
<p>
Comments from the community about CloudRouter 2.0 beta:
<p>
"CloudRouter is a great open source routing project that works well with OSv and benefits from 
the performance that OSv brings to applications," said Dor Laor, co­founder and CEO of 
Cloudius Systems. "Our team enjoys working with other CloudRouter developers to make sure 
CloudRouter components like OpenDaylight are optimized for high performance routing by 
using OSv."
<p>
"I'm excited that FastNetMon is now included in the CloudRouter Project," said Pavel Odinstov, 
head of the FastNetMon Project and CTO of FastVPS. "The project is a benefit to the open 
source community and network operators looking for an open source router. As the new version 
includes FastNetMon for the first time, I encourage people interested in DDoS and DoS 
mitigation with FastNetMon to look at the CloudRouter Project."

<h3>About the CloudRouter Project</h3>
<p>
The CloudRouter Project is a collaborative open source project to develop a freely available 
software­based router designed to securely run on physical, virtual and cloud environments that 
support software­defined networking infrastructures. CloudRouter aims to facilitate migration to 
the cloud without giving up control over network routing and governance. It includes the features 
of traditional hardware routers, as well as support for emerging technologies such as containers 
and software­defined interconnection. To help bridge legacy infrastructure with the cloud, the 
project is  focused on bringing simplicity to network interconnection, a traditionally complex 
process. The CloudRouter Project sponsors include Australia National University, CloudBees, 
Cloudius Systems, IIX, NGINX and OpenDaylight.
