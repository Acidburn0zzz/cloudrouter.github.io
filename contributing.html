<h2>Contributing code to CloudRouter repos</h2>
<p>The CloudRouter Project welcomes contributions from all members of the community.  We ask that when making contributions, you follow these simple guidelines.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Forks and pull requests</h3>
<p>
<p>In order to contribute code to any CloudRouter Project repo, please maintain a personal fork and commit your changes there first.  Once you are ready to submit your changes for review and merging into a CloudRouter Project repo, create a pull request.  The Travis CI system will automatically run some basic tests on your pull request before it is reviewed by a CloudRouter Project committer.  It is encouraged that you use a <a title="feature branch" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow/"></a> when contributing code or fixing a bug.</p>
