CloudRouter is open source and we encourage companies to take our software and freely use it both in their business and to build a business.  Up until now, our focus has been on using CloudRouter in your business, not building a business based on CloudRouter.  That's changing.

Today, CloudRouter is helping both hardware vendors sell more hardware and network service providers sell more infrastructure connections.  As we prepare for version 4.0 we're facing requirements from both large scale network infrastructure providers that have CloudRouter in production as well as a number of hardware vendors that CloudRouter works with or can be installed on.

Before diving into the future of CloudRouter and how it might impact your business, let's take a quick look at the past.

At the launch of CloudRouter, we focused on building a great experience for an end-user virtual router that could run anywhere.  Our primary target was people interested in layer 3 routing on whitebox hardware.  We provided images to enable installation in minutes.  We soon followed up with AWS packages for people that wanted to deploy virtual routers in the cloud.  With version 1.0 of CloudRouter, people used it for network testing, edge routing, and fundamental functions like BGP.

With version 2.0 of CloudRouter, we saw more experimentations and tests with CloudRouter as an open source network platform for new architectures, a community hub for SDN and network performance projects. Many people used CloudRouter as a way to easily install the open source ONOS and OpenDaylight projects with tested components.

With version 3.0 of CloudRouter, hardware vendors began to engage with the open source networking community. Vendors of 100 GigE cards like Mellanox helped us test CloudRouter for use in SDN-enabled whitebox architecture. Although, we only announced test results with Mellanox, that was just the beginning.

Behind the scenes, CloudRouter was in deployment at a major carrier with Intel 100 GigE cards using DPDK. We’re also getting Arista hardware to test CloudRouter running on their equipment, a potentially major shift in how people think of network hardware and software. We’re also ready to launch software in conjunction with ANU to help with the automation of layer 3 routing.

**Building Businesses by Adding Value on CloudRouter**

What does all this mean for businesses?  CloudRouter technology will be delivered to you embedded in other services, possibly even other hardware.  You may already be using CloudRouter right now and not even known it.
