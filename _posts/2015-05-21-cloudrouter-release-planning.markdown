Hi again!  Guess what?  It is time to start a discussion on future
CloudRouter releases.  What should be included?  What release
schedule should the project follow?  Who will be responsible for
what in the next release?  How about the release after that?

Join the CloudRouter Project Team on Thursday, June 4th @ 16:00
Pacific (UTC-7) for an open IRC meeting hosted on the #cloudrouter
channel at Freenode to discuss and take input on the upcoming
roadmap for CloudRouter.

The community's input will be used to create the roadmap for the
project with a focus on what features and enhancements will be part
of the rleease cycle.  The roadmap for each release will be described
in a blog post after the planning meeting along with a hardened
schedule.

If you cannot attend the discussion on IRC, you can make feature
requests by opening a new JIRA issue at [Issues](https://issues.cloudrouter.org)
and prefix your reuqest with "[RFE]" in the Summary line.  The issue
will be used to track the discussions about the new feature, and if
accepted will be added to our backlog.  We also encourage people to 
discuss any ideas for future releases on the developers mailing list,
[devel@lists.cloudrouter.org](http://lists.cloudrouter.org/mailman/listinfo/devel/).
A detailed list of planned features will be available on the [CloudRouter
Release Management](https://cloudrouter.atlassian.net/wiki.x.fAAZ) page.

See [CloudRouter Project](https://cloudrouter.org) for more information
about the project.

The [Freenode FAQ](https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml) is a great
resource if you are new to Freenode.


Thanks,
Jay Turner
CloudRouter Project Lead
