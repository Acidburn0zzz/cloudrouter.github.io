The CloudRouter® Project today announced a collaboration with Princeton University designed to fundamentally change the interdomain traffic delivery by dramatically improving performance and scalability of [Software Defined Exchange Points (SDX)](http://sdx.cs.princeton.edu/index.html).  SDX has been significantly rewritten as iSDX to improve performance and scalability on an "industrial scale," hence the additional "i".  By teaming with CloudRouter, researchers at Princeton University will be able to test iSDX in the real world on an industrial scale.

"CloudRouter and Princeton are working closely together on upstream technology development to move SDN forward. This is a glimpse of the next-generation of SDX progressing beyond academic theory and into real-world industrial use cases,” said David Jorm, Senior Manager, Product Security and Technology Services at IIX and CloudRouter Academic Research Partnerships Liaison. “This shows the flexibility of using open source network technologies in carrier networks and demonstrates the potential to solve SDN problems through collaboration.”

With SDX, layer 3 routing decisions can be based on many diverse attributes of packets, not just the destination IP. This enables applications such as inbound traffic engineering, redirection of traffic to middleboxes, wide-area server load balancing, and blocking of unwanted traffic. An SDX controller, developed at Princeton, enables routing decisions and collaboration between ISPs that is more flexible than today’s Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)-based routing.

"At Princeton, my work focuses on the intersection of Internet Routing and SDN. I am thankful to the CloudRouter Project for allowing me to work on-site with their team and model a production network to help increase the understanding of real-world industry issues," said Arpit Gupta, Princeton University, Computer Science Department. "It is very exciting to explore how iSDX can eventually be deployed to solve real-world interconnection problems.”

CloudRouter is known for strong academic connections. In 2015, CloudRouter announced [a technology partnership with Australia National University](https://cloudrouter.org/releases/cloudrouter-anu-techlauncher-partnership.html) to build layer 3 router configuration automation technology for the OpenDaylight Project.

**About the CloudRouter Project**

The CloudRouter Project is a collaborative open source project to develop a freely available software-based router designed to securely run on physical, virtual and cloud environments that support software-defined networking infrastructures. CloudRouter aims to facilitate migration to the cloud without giving up control over network routing and governance. It includes the features of traditional hardware routers, as well as support for emerging technologies such as containers and software-defined interconnection. To help bridge legacy infrastructure with the cloud, the project is focused on bringing simplicity to network interconnection, a traditionally complex process. The CloudRouter Project sponsors include Australia National University, CloudBees, Cloudius Systems, IIX, NGINX, OpenDaylight and Princeton University.
