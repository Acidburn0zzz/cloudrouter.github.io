A little over a week ago, I sent email to the users list asking for opinions on utilizing [Gitter](https://gitter.im) for chatting about the CloudRouter Project.  A few of us played with it here in the office, and based on no one yelling too loudly, consider it done!  Right now there is a [cloudrouter](https://gitter.im/cloudrouter) channel which should work for general discussion, and a [cloudrouter/cloudrouter](https://gitter.im/cloudrouter/cloudrouter) channel whose purpose is a little more nebulous.  My thinking was to have a general discussion channel (cloudrouter) as well as repo-specific channels which would serve as the primary location for commit messages, continuous integration results, JIRA-related traffic, etc.  Let's play around for the next few weeks and see what everone thinks!

Some helpful tips about Gitter:

* Make a msitake??  Gitter supports in-line corrections
  * Type *s/msitake/mistake/* to fix it!

* Talk about issues
  * Any issue.  Just type owner/repo# and you can reference issues across any room.  If you are already in a repo room, just type *#* for issues in that repo.

* Apps!  Get your hot and fresh apps
  * Visit [Apps](https://gitter.im/apps) to download one of the apps.  Gitter has apps for Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, and Android (4.4+)

* Automatic markdown code recognition
  * Gitter supports [full markdown support](https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200176682-Markdown-basics).  Type *'''* and hit <Enter>.  [Compose mode](https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201302311-Compose-mode) auto toggles on and your backticks will be closed automatically.  <Cmd>+<Enter> to send the message and automatically return to chat mode.

* Lastly, the Gitter team hangs out at [gitterHQ/gitter](https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter) and loves when people drop in and let the team know how to improve Gitter.

Lastly, important to note that IRC is not dead (yet!).  Gitter even includes an [IRC gateway](https://irc.gitter.im) which makes those of us stuck in the 80's much happier!

Comments/questions/thoughts/complaints?  That is what the users@ mailing list is for!  Looking forward to seeing everyone on Gitter!
